# Deployment explaination
Sure, let's break down the `docker-compose.yml` file for your project, explaining each service one by one. This file orchestrates the deployment of multiple services that are essential for a data science environment, including PostgreSQL, Jupyter, Streamlit, and MLflow.

### 1. **PostgreSQL Service**

```yaml
postgres:
  image: postgres:latest
  environment:
    POSTGRES_DB: datascience
    POSTGRES_USER: user
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
  ports:
    - "5432:5432"
  volumes:
    - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

- **image**: Specifies the Docker image to use for the container. Here, it uses the latest version of the official PostgreSQL image.
- **environment**: Sets environment variables in the container. `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` are used to define the default database, user, and password, respectively.
- **ports**: Maps port 5432 on the host to port 5432 on the container, allowing external access to the PostgreSQL database.
- **volumes**: Mounts a volume at `/var/lib/postgresql/data` inside the container, which is the default location where PostgreSQL stores its data. This ensures data persistence across container restarts.

### 2. **Jupyter Service**

```yaml
jupyter:
  image: jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest
  environment:
    JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB: "yes"
  volumes:
    - ./notebooks:/home/jovyan/work
  ports:
    - "8888:8888"
  depends_on:
    - postgres
```

- **image**: Uses a specific Jupyter Docker image that includes SciPy libraries, facilitating scientific computing.
- **environment**: Optional variable `JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB` that, when set to "yes", runs JupyterLab by default instead of the classic Jupyter Notebook UI.
- **volumes**: Maps a local directory (`./notebooks`) to the container's working directory where Jupyter saves notebooks (`/home/jovyan/work`). This mapping ensures that notebooks created in the container persist on the host machine.
- **ports**: Exposes port 8888 (default for Jupyter) on both the host and container, allowing access to the Jupyter interface via a web browser.
- **depends_on**: Ensures that Jupyter starts only after the PostgreSQL service is up and running.

### 3. **Streamlit Service**

```yaml
streamlit:
  image: python:3.8
  command: bash -c "pip install streamlit pandas psycopg2 SQLAlchemy && streamlit run app.py"
  volumes:
    - ./streamlit:/app
  ports:
    - "8501:8501"
  depends_on:
    - postgres
  working_dir: /app
```

- **image**: Uses the official Python 3.8 image as the base.
- **command**: Runs a bash command that installs necessary Python packages and starts the Streamlit application defined in `app.py`.
- **volumes**: Mounts a local `streamlit` directory to `/app` in the container. This directory contains the Streamlit application files.
- **ports**: Maps port 8501 on the host to port 8501 on the container, allowing access to the Streamlit web interface.
- **depends_on**: Ensures Streamlit does not start until the PostgreSQL database is available.
- **working_dir**: Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`, where the Streamlit script is located.

### 4. **MLflow Service**

```yaml
mlflow:
  build: ./mlflow/
  ports:
    - "5000:5000"
  volumes:
    - ./mlflow:/mlflow
  depends_on:
    - postgres
```

- **build**: Instead of using an image, this service builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile located in the `./mlflow/` directory. This custom image includes the MLflow tracking server.
- **ports**: Exposes port 5000 on both the host and container, necessary for accessing the MLflow tracking UI.
- **volumes**: Maps a local `mlflow` directory to `/mlflow` in the container, ensuring that artifacts and other MLflow data persist outside the container.
- **depends_on**: Specifies that MLflow requires the PostgreSQL service to be running before it starts, as it uses PostgreSQL for backend storage.

This `docker-compose.yml` file efficiently orchestrates a complex data science environment, ensuring each component interacts seamlessly and is easily accessible for development and analysis tasks.
