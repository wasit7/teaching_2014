### Chapter 3: Jupyter Deployment

#### Overview
In this chapter, we explore the deployment of Jupyter Notebook within a Docker container, integrating with PostgreSQL for database operations. Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive computing environment where you can mix executable code, rich text, visualizations, and other rich media in a single document. This setup is particularly useful for data exploration, visualization, and interactive data science.

#### 1. Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

#### 2. Docker Compose Configuration for Jupyter
Using the Docker Compose setup from Chapter 1, here's how the Jupyter service is defined:

```yaml
jupyter:
  image: jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest
  environment:
    JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB: "yes"  # Optional: Enables JupyterLab interface
  volumes:
    - ./notebooks:/home/jovyan/work  # Maps notebook directory to host
  ports:
    - "8888:8888"  # Exposes Jupyter on localhost:8888
  depends_on:
    - postgres  # Ensures PostgreSQL is running first
```

#### 3. Accessing and Using Jupyter Notebook
- **Starting Jupyter Notebook**:
  Run the following command to start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
- **Accessing Jupyter**:
  Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8888`. You will need a token or password to access Jupyter, which can be found in the logs:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs jupyter
  ```

#### 4. Connecting Jupyter to PostgreSQL
- **Setting Up a Connection**:
  Using SQLAlchemy, you can connect Jupyter to the PostgreSQL database. Here's a simple test to establish a connection:
  ```python
  from sqlalchemy import create_engine
  con_str = "postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@postgres:5432/datascience"
  engine = create_engine(con_str)
  conn = engine.connect()
  print(conn)
  ```

#### 5. Basic Database Operations from Jupyter
- **Listing Tables in the Database**:
  ```python
  def list_table():
      engine = create_engine(con_str)
      metadata = MetaData()
      metadata.reflect(bind=engine)
      print("Tables in the database:")
      for table in metadata.tables.values():
          print(table.name)

  list_table()
  ```
- **Creating and Inserting Data into Tables**:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.DataFrame({
      'col1': [1, 2, 3],
      'col2': [4, 5, 6]
  })
  df.to_sql(name='my_table', con=con_str)  # Creates a new table and inserts data
  list_table()  # Verify the new table is created
  ```

#### 6. Best Practices and Tips
- **Security**: Avoid exposing the Jupyter server to public networks without proper authentication and encryption.
- **Data Persistence**: Using Docker volumes ensures that your notebooks and data are not lost when the Docker container is restarted or removed.
- **Resource Management**: Monitor the resources used by the Jupyter container, especially when running complex computations.

#### Conclusion
Deploying Jupyter as part of a Dockerized environment provides a flexible, secure, and scalable way to perform data analysis and scientific computing. This setup facilitates easy sharing of notebooks between team members and reproducibility of results, making it invaluable for collaborative data science projects.
