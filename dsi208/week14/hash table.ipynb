    "The modulo operation is a mathematical operation that finds the remainder when one number is divided by another. In programming and mathematics, it's often represented by the percentage sign (`%`). The result of a modulo operation is always less than the divisor and can be thought of as the amount left over after division.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Modulo Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "When you perform the operation \\( a \\mod b \\), where \\( a \\) is the dividend and \\( b \\) is the divisor, the result is the remainder from dividing \\( a \\) by \\( b \\). Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( 7 \\mod 3 \\) equals 1, because when you divide 7 by 3, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is 1.\n",
    "- \\( 10 \\mod 2 \\) equals 0, because 10 is evenly divisible by 2.\n",
    "- \\( 15 \\mod 4 \\) equals 3, because dividing 15 by 4 results in a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modulo Operation in Hash Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In hash functions, the modulo operation is used to ensure that the hash code (the result of the hash function) fits within the bounds of the available array indices. For instance, if you have an array of 10 elements and a hash function calculates a hash code of 56 for a given key, using modulo \\( 56 \\mod 10 \\) will result in 6, meaning the key-value pair should be placed in index 6 of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Example Demonstrating Modulo Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s illustrate how the modulo operation works with a simple Python example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Examples of modulo operation\n",
    "print(7 % 3)  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(10 % 2)  # Output: 0\n",
    "print(15 % 4)  # Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Practical use in a hash function\n",
    "def simple_hash(key, array_size):\n",
    "    # Assume key is an integer for simplicity\n",
    "    hash_code = key\n",
    "    return hash_code % array_size\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the hash function with different keys\n",
    "array_size = 10\n",
    "keys = [34, 56, 78, 90]\n",
    "\n",
    "for key in keys:\n",
    "    index = simple_hash(key, array_size)\n",
    "    print(f\"Key: {key} => Index: {index}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Explanation:\n",
    "- **Modulo Results**: The first three print statements show the results of the modulo operations, which are straightforward calculations.\n",
    "- **Hash Function**: The `simple_hash` function takes a numerical key and an array size, then uses the modulo operation to compute an index where the key should be placed in an array of the given size. The results illustrate how different keys are mapped to indices in an array of size 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "This explanation and example demonstrate the practical use of the modulo operation, particularly in the context of hash functions in data structures like hash tables, where it ensures that data is distributed evenly and efficiently across the available storage space."

This will serve as a solid foundation for data science students to understand and utilize hash tables efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lecture Notes: Introduction to Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What is a Hash Table?\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash table is a data structure that stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access to data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data. Hash tables use a \"hash function\" to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Characteristics of Hash Tables:\n",
    "- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Hash tables provide fast data retrieval via direct access of the index through the hash function.\n",
    "- **Handling Collisions**: When two keys hash to the same index, collisions are resolved using techniques such as chaining or open addressing.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Resizing**: Most hash table implementations increase the size of the hash array when the load factor (ratio of entries to hash table size) exceeds a certain threshold, to maintain the efficiency of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Components of Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hash Function**: Converts a key into an index in the array where the value associated with the key is found or stored. The effectiveness of a hash function is measured by how well it distributes data across the hash table.\n",
    "- **Buckets**: Each position in the hash table array, often called a \"bucket\", can hold one or more entries. The method to store entries defines whether chaining or open addressing is used.\n",
    "- **Collision Resolution Techniques**:\n",
    "  - **Chaining**: Each bucket contains a linked list of entries that have the same hash index.\n",
    "  - **Open Addressing**: All entry records are stored within the array itself. When a new entry needs to be inserted, the hash array is searched sequentially starting from the hashed index until an empty slot is found.\n",

    "#### 3.1 Efficient Data Retrieval (Full Text Search Indexing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**  \n",
    "Full text search is a complex problem in data science and software development, requiring efficient searching over large volumes of text. Hash tables play a crucial role in building indexing systems that allow for fast retrieval of information. Full text search indexing typically involves mapping keywords or phrases to their occurrences in a dataset, which can be efficiently done using a hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario and Basic Implementation:**  \n",
    "Consider a scenario where we need to implement a basic full text search over a set of documents or articles. Each word or term in the document can be stored as a key in a hash table, with the value being a list of documents or specific positions within documents where the term appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Example of Full Text Search Indexing Using a Hash Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class FullTextSearchIndex:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.index = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "    def add_document(self, document_id, text):\n",
    "        words = text.split()\n",

    "            if word not in self.index:\n",
    "                self.index[word] = []\n",
    "            self.index[word].append(document_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def search(self, term):\n",
    "        return self.index.get(term, [])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "index = FullTextSearchIndex()\n",
    "index.add_document(1, \"Hash tables support efficient retrieval of data.\")\n",
    "index.add_document(2, \"Full text search uses hash tables for indexing.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Search for a term\n",
    "print(index.search(\"hash\"))  # Output: [1, 2]\n",
    "print(index.search(\"data\"))  # Output: [1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "- **Initialization**: A new `FullTextSearchIndex` class is created with an empty hash table.\n",
    "- **Adding Documents**: When a document is added, the text is split into words, and each word is added to the hash table. The document ID is appended to the list of document IDs associated with each word.\n",
    "- **Searching**: To find all documents containing a specific term, the hash table is queried to fetch the list of document IDs associated with the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation shows how hash tables facilitate quick look-ups and are ideal for indexing in full text search systems, where the efficiency of data retrieval is paramount.\n",

    "#### 3.2 Caching Mechanisms (API Caching)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**\n",
    "Caching is a critical mechanism in improving the performance of data retrieval systems, especially in environments where data access is a costly operation (e.g., network requests or database queries). API caching uses hash tables to temporarily store the results of API calls, so that subsequent requests for the same data can be served quickly from the cache, reducing load on the server and speeding up response times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario and Basic Implementation:**\n",
    "Imagine we are developing an application that consumes a weather API. This API provides the current weather information for a given city. To reduce the number of requests to the API and enhance our application's responsiveness, we can implement caching using a hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Example of API Caching Using a Hash Table:**\n",
    "\n",

    "print(cached_weather)  # Output: {'temp': 72, 'condition': 'Sunny'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Initialization**: The `APICache` class initializes a hash table to store API responses. Each entry in the hash table stores a tuple containing the response and the time it was stored.\n",
    "- **Getting Data**: When data is requested, the cache checks if the item exists and whether it has expired. If not expired, it returns the cached data.\n",
    "- **Setting Data**: When data is stored, it is entered into the hash table along with the current timestamp.\n",

    "Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines access levels based on attributes (characteristics) associated with users, resources, or the environment. This model is flexible and context-aware, allowing for dynamic policies that adapt to varied scenarios. ABAC is similar to the model used in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), where policies can specify permissions based on user attributes, resource tags, and other contextual data. Hash tables are ideal for implementing ABAC due to their efficiency in handling lookups, inserts, and deletions.\n",

    "The `check_access` method in the ABACSystem class, which uses a hash table to manage access rules, primarily revolves around the efficiency of hash table operations, particularly the lookup operation. Let's break down the time complexity of this method:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of the `check_access` Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hash Table Lookup Operation**: \n",
    "   - The `check_access` function performs a lookup in the hash table (`self.rules`) using the key composed of `(user_role, resource_type, action_requested)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time Complexity of Lookup**: \n",
    "   - In the best and average cases, hash table lookups have a time complexity of \\(O(1)\\), meaning they execute in constant time regardless of the size of the hash table. This efficiency is due to the direct access nature of hash tables, where the hash function computes the index in the array directly from the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Worst Case Scenario**: \n",
    "   - The worst-case time complexity of a hash table lookup can degrade to \\(O(N)\\) if all keys hash to the same index, leading to a long chain (in case of chaining) or a full table needing extensive probing (in case of open addressing). However, with a well-designed hash function and a sufficiently large hash table relative to the number of entries (maintaining a low load factor), this scenario can generally be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hash Function Performance**: \n",
    "   - The time complexity also depends on the efficiency of the hash function used. The hash function in this scenario involves hashing a tuple of three elements (role, resource, action). If the hash function is designed to be efficient and the elements of the tuple have a reasonable distribution and size, the time to compute the hash will be very minimal and effectively constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Practical Considerations**: \n",
    "   - In practice, the implementation of hash tables in high-level languages like Python is highly optimized. Python dictionaries, for instance, are built on top of hash tables and are designed to handle collisions efficiently using a combination of techniques including resizing the hash table and second-level hashing, which help maintain the average-case time complexity close to \\(O(1)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `check_access` method in the `ABACSystem`, the time complexity is \\(O(1)\\) on average, which is the expected case under normal circumstances with a well-distributed workload and a proficient hash function. This makes hash table an excellent choice for this kind of access control system, where quick determination of access permissions is crucial. Ensuring that the hash function is efficient and that the system can handle a growing number of rules through appropriate scaling and management of the hash table is key to maintaining this performance."
